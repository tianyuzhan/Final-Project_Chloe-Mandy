To commit a Metropolis Hastling alogorithm we start from a random variable from uniform distribution. Then we jump to the candidate based on our proposal function ~~~(1)
But here we should be aware of the fact that Beta distribution is not symmmetric, so we need to add a correction to the posterior factor, that is ~~~ (2). For example, ~~~(3). After that, we get acceptance ratio r, r=
Then we compare r to u~ Uniform(0,1). If r > u we accept it and jump to the new point, or we remain unmoved at current state. 
The whole process loops designated times as iterations, and normally we need to do thining and burn in to reduce autocorrelation and get desired distribution.

```{r}
hist(rbeta(10000,6,4),freq=FALSE)
mh.beta(1,10000)
```
The histogram of our simulation is more sken to the left compared to beta(6,4) and p-value from K-S Test equals 2.2e-16, which strongly reject that our simulation comes from Beta(6,4).

```{r}
mh.beta(0.1,10000)
mh.beta(2.5,10000)
mh.beta(10,10000) 
```
Overall, c=2.5 is the most effective.From the ACF plot, we could see clearly that we need to do systematic sampling to thin the simulation whe n c=0.1 and c=10. Although c=10 tends to perform a little better than c=0.1. The histogram for c=0.1 is also very wired, and overall distribution is far more unstable and fat-tail than beta distribution. Still, c=10 is better than c=0.1 and c=2.5 is the best with the shape most alike to beta(6,4). 

For further improve the performance for c=0.1 and c=10 I modify the code to add one line of burn-in and systematic sampling as follows:
```{r}
thinmh.beta <- function(c,n.sims,burnIn) {
  x.update <- function(x.cur,c) {
    # choosing candidate
    x.can <- rbeta(1, c*x.cur, c*(1-x.cur))
    a1 <- dbeta(x.can, 6,4)/dbeta(x.cur,6,4)
    # jumping distribution
    a2_num <- dbeta(x.cur, c*x.cur, c*(1-x.cur))
    a2_den <- dbeta(x.can, c*x.can, c*(1-x.can))
    a2 <- a2_num / a2_den
    # adjusted acceptance probability
    accept.prob <- (a2 * (dbeta(x.can,6,4)/dbeta(x.cur,6,4)))
    if (runif(1) <= accept.prob) x.cur=x.can
    else x.cur
    return(x.cur)
  }
  draws <- c()
  x.cur <- runif(1)
  for (i in 1:n.sims) {
    draws[i] <- x.cur
    x.cur <- x.update(x.cur,c)
  }
  # Add an line of thining and burnIn.
  draws <-draws[seq((burnIn+1),n.sims,by=30)]
  par(mfrow=c(1,3))
  plot(draws,ylim=c(0,1),main = paste("Trace plot after thining: c = ", c, sep=""))
  acf(draws,ylim=c(0,1),main= paste("Autocorrelation Plot after thining: c = ", c, sep=""))
  hist(draws, main=paste("Histogram after thining: c = ", c, sep=""),freq=FALSE)
  comp <- ks.test(draws[!duplicated(draws)], "pbeta",6,4)
  print (comp)
  return()
}
```

```{r}
thinmh.beta(0.1,10000,1000)
thinmh.beta(0.1,10000,300)
thinmh.beta(10,10000,300)
thinmh.beta(10,10000,100)
```
We could see from ACF plot that to reduce the dependency of variables, the case that c=0.1 needs more burnIn than c=10 to become stable. Also,
